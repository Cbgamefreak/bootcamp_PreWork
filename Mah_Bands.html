    <h3>Bio:</h3>
    <p>Bassnectar is the brainchild of Lorin Ashton, a San Francisco-based DJ, producer and artist. Lorin, who released his first album in 2001, began the project as an open-sourced musical experiment exploring the interplay between music and community. His music fuses everything into an electro-synthesis of intense basslines and hypnotic soundscapes.</p>
    <p>Coming from a background in death metal, Ashton was not intent on approaching EDM from a traditional standpoint and it was a very natural and unique progression. It is this openness to exploring new ways of creating dance music that has attracted droves of loyal fans to Bassnectarâ€™s recordings and live performances. Being purposely limitless, Bassnectar is as diverse as it is heavy, as raw as it is meticulous, and as fierce as it is imaginary.</p>
